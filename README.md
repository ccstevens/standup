# Stand Up!

A "20-20-20 Rule" application that reminds you to get out of your chair, stop
looking at your screen, and take a short break every 20 minutes.

# Motivation

While sitting at my desk for too long building
[Minoca OS](https://www.github.com/minoca/os), I developed back pain. My
physical therapist introduced me to the 20-20-20 rule, so I figured it would be
fun to build an app for myself.

# Source

It's an Electron application written in JavaScript. As I typically deal in
kernel code, this is my first JavaScript based application. Feedback encouraged.
